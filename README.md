# Malicious File detection


## About the project

- In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade 
traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks. 
The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software is a malware.

## Dataset

- Microsoft has been very active in building anti-malware products over the years and it runs itâ€™s anti-malware utilities over 150 million 
computers around the world. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware. In order to be 
effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of data, we need to be able to group them into groups and identify their 
respective families.

- This dataset provided by Microsoft contains about 9 classes of malware. ,
